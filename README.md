# Schedoscope

## Introduction

Schedoscope is a scheduling framework for painfree agile development, testing, (re)loading, and monitoring of your datahub, lake, or whatever you choose to call your Hadoop data warehouse these days.

With Schedoscope,
* you never have to create DDL and schema migration scripts;
* you do not have to manually determine which data must be deleted and recomputed in face of retroactive changes to logic or data structures;
* you specify Hive table structures (called "views"), partitioning schemes, storage formats, dependent views, as well as transformation logic in a concise Scala DSL;
* you have a wide range of options for expressing data transformations - from file operations and MapReduce jobs to Pig scripts, Hive queries, and Oozie workflows;
* you benefit from Scala's static type system and your IDE's code completion to make less typos that hit you late during deployment or runtime;
* you can easily write unit tests for your transformation logic and run them quickly right out of your IDE;
* you schedule jobs by expressing the views you need - Schedoscope takes care that all required dependencies - and only those-  are computed as well;
* you achieve a higher utilization of your YARN cluster's resources because job launchers are not YARN applications themselves that consume cluster capacitity.

## When is Schedoscope not for you?

Schedoscope is based on the following assumptions:
* data are largely relational and meaningfully representable as Hive tables;
* there is enough cluster time and capacity to actually allow for retroactive recomputation of data;
* it is acceptable to compile table structures, dependencies, and transformation logic into what is effectively a project-specific scheduler.

Should any of those assumptions not hold in your context, you should probably look for a different scheduler.

## Origins

Schedoscope was conceived at the Business Intelligence department of [Otto Group](http://ottogroup.com/en/die-otto-group.php)
