/**
 * Trait for user defined code to be executed before and after  a transformation. e.g. for gathering statistics
 * and logging information from the execution framework (e.g. mapreduce)
 *
 * As for exceptions:
 *
 * Should a failure within the completion handler not cause the transformation to fail, the exception should be suppressed.
 *
 * Should a failure within the completion handler cause a restart of the driver actor and a redo of the transformation,
 * it should be raised as a DriverException.
 *
 * Any other raised exception will cause the driver run to fail and the transformation subsequently to be retried by the view actor.
